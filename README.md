# TRANSPOSE

**An open, reproducible ecosystem for travel demand modeling.**

TRANSPOSE hosts **TDToolkit**, a collection of interoperable, open-source components designed to advance travel demand research and practice.  
The goal is to make modeling more **transparent, reproducible, and policy-relevant** through standardized datasets, benchmarks, and methods.

## TDToolkit Components

The core modules of TDToolkit live in separate repositories, but integrate under a shared schema and benchmarking framework:

- **[DCMBench](https://github.com/transpose-org/DCMBench)**  
  Baseline datasets and model benchmarks with classical discrete choice models.

- **[ML-DCM-Bench](https://github.com/transpose-org/ML-DCM-Bench)**  
  Standardized evaluation across hundreds of ML and DCMs with reproducible splits and metrics.

- **[TransitCast](https://github.com/transpose-org/TransitCast)**  
  Applying benchmark models to transit ridership forecasting.

- **[DNN-Econ](https://github.com/transpose-org/DNN-Econ)**  
  Economic metrics (elasticities, welfare) for DCMs and DNNs.

- **[ASU-DNN](https://github.com/transpose-org/ASU-DNN)**  
  Hybrid architecture integrating DCMs and DNNs.
